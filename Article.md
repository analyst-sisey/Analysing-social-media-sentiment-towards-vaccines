Building NLP models for sentiment analysis using Huggingface and Gradio

NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a field of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It involves the use of techniques to process, analyze, and generate human language text and speech. It gives machines the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages.
 Sentiment analysis is a specific application of NLP that involves identifying and extracting subjective information from text, such as determining the emotional tone of a statement. It can be used to analyze customer feedback, social media posts, and other forms of text data to understand public opinion and attitudes. It uses machine learning and lexical analysis to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral in sentiment. It is often used in social media monitoring, customer service, and market research.
This project will walk you through how to create a model that will classify tweets made on covid19 vaccines as pro-vaccine, neutral or anti-vaccine. We will build 2 sentiment analysis models and compare their performance. These models will not be built from scratch. However, we will be using pre-trained models from huggingface.

Huggingface is an AI-powered open-source platform for natural language processing (NLP) that provides access to pre-trained models, datasets, and evaluation metrics. It allows developers to easily train, test and deploy natural language processing models and build applications such as chatbots, language translation, and text summarization. The platform also includes a collection of state-of-the-art pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text generation. Hugging Face also provides easy-to-use tools to train, test and deploy models and offers integration with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
There are several advantages to using pre-trained models from Hugging Face as opposed to building your model from scratch. We will discuss the advantages of huggingface in another article.
The steps involved in fine-tuning a Hugging Face model can vary depending on the specific use case and task, but a general process would involve the following steps:
Choose a pre-trained model: Select a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face model library that is appropriate for your task.
Prepare your data: Prepare your labeled dataset for fine-tuning. This will typically involve preprocessing the data, such as tokenizing and padding the text.
Configure the model: Configure the model for fine-tuning by specifying the parameters such as the number of layers to fine-tune, the learning rate, and the batch size.
Train the model: Train the model on your labeled data by specifying the number of training epochs.
Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on a held-out test set to measure its accuracy.
Save and deploy the model: Save the fine-tuned model in a format that can be loaded and used in your application.
Fine-tune further: Repeat steps 4-6 as necessary with different parameters or with different subsets of the data to further improve the performance of the model.

Note: This is a general process and might vary depending on the specific use case, task, and the pre-trained model you choose.

Now let us go through these steps to build our model. For a detailed explanation and code, you can access the project notebook here.

Choose a pre-trained model: We will be training 2 models. The DistilBERT model and the roBERTa-base model. These models have been pre-trained to perform the task we are about to perform. You can explore the models' hub on huggingface for a list of pre-trained models and the task they are trained to perform.
Prepare your data: As we discussed earlier, our data comes from tweets on vaccines collected and classified through Crowdbreaks.org. The tweets are a mixture of Twitter posts related to vaccinations that are positive, neutral, and negative. We first split our train data into training and evaluation data. We then passed it through the tokenizer for breaking up the data or sequence of tweets into smaller chunks, called tokens. 
Configure the model: We configure our models by calling the AutoModelForSequenceClassification function and passing the needed parameters. For our models, we used the default parameters.
Train the model: We first defined the training arguments such as num_train_epochs and evaluation_strategy. We also set the push_to_hub argument to True so that our trained model will be pushed to our hugging face repo. We then call the .train() method to start training. Training can take a while depending on the number of epochs and your compute power. 
Evaluate the model: For evaluation, we set our evaluation load_metric() parameter to accuracy. This means that during the training process, the model's performance will be measured by how well it correctly classified or predicted the outcome. 

After training, our models did not perform badly. The DistilBERT model had an accuracy score of  0.753000 whiles the roBERTa-base model had an accuracy score of 0.664000.

The importance of NLP and sentiment analysis lies in the ability to process and understand large amounts of unstructured text data, which is the most common format in which information is available. This allows organizations to gain insights from customer feedback, social media, and other sources to improve products, services, and customer engagement. Sentiment analysis also can be used in various applications such as marketing, customer service, and political campaign.

Huggingface models are pre-trained, easy to use, and provide high-quality results. They have a wide variety of models for different tasks and are regularly updated with new versions. They are interoperable with other NLP libraries and have a simple API for loading and using the models. Using Huggingface models can save time and effort for NLP tasks. They are trained on large datasets and have shown state-of-the-art performance on a variety of NLP tasks.

We will look at how to deploy our models using gradio and also how to compare the results of the 2 models using a single gradio interface in our next post
